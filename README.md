# Stardew Valley Cookbook

A searchable cookbook for the recipes found in the video game Stardew Valley.

## Description

I love the video game Stardew Valley! One thing I have noticed while playing it is that there are a lot of different recipes you can make. Sometimes when I come across an item in the game, I do not remember which recipes it can be used in, if any. That is why I decided to create this Stardew Valley Cookbook which allows you to search by ingredient to see which recipes it is used in. You can also search by recipe title to see which ingredients you need to make a reicipe. I am working on adding a favorites feature, so you will be able to login and favorite recipes you want to be able to look at quickly. In addition, I will add the ability to mark recipes you have already made so that it will be easy to see which ones you still need to make on your quest to make them all!
